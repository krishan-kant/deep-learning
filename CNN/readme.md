CNN

This file uses Convolutional Neural Network to categorize data into two categories.

Preprocessing:
Data needs to provided in dataset folder with seperate folder dividing the train and test data. Data preprocessing is not done in the file as it has to be done manually by dividing the data into folders.

Improvements:
The program was tested on a very low specs computer and changes must be made to increase the accuracy by increasing the number of CNN and ANN.
